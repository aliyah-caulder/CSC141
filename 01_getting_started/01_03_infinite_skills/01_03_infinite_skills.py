"""Here are three programs I'd like to create if I had infinite skills.
1. I would like to create a visual novel game. I started creating a game like this for my internal assessment my senior year of 
highschool, but never finished it and the interfaces and art were low quality. I'd like to create a full game that I am satisfied 
with and works to create a compelling and interactive story.
2. I think I'd like to create an app or program that combined many digital tools I use for personal use. It would include a calendar, 
lists, reminders, schedules, maybe even interfaces for playing music and minigames. The interface would be completely customizable to
match the user's preferred aesthetics. I think it could also be useful for it to include dropboxes for files for cross-platform access.
3. I think another good game idea would be an adventure game. The player could progress and it could use turn based fighting styles. 
I would also be able to create a good story and aesthetics."""
