# The files for this assignment are employee.py and test_employee.py
# Employee.py creates a class representing an employee and test_employee tests that salary can be raised through the default value
# as well as a custom value, using the @pytest.fixture decorative.
# Both tests pass.
# I'd give this assignment a 6 on difficulty because it took some thinking and I learned to use @pytest.fixture.
